Without a Tier 5 Blood Altar, you canâ€™t get a whole lot of mileage out of Living Armor, primarily because you need a few rituals in order to upgrade and customise the Armor. These Advanced Rituals are craftable with a Tier 4 Altar, but you will not be able to activate them without crafting an Awakened Activation Crystal, which is crafted with an Archmage Blood Orb and a Nether Star. The rituals are briefly described below but are covered more extensively later on.
