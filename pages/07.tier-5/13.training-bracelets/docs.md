Training Bracelets are easily crafted and can be combined with Trait Tomes, these Bracelets act as a whitelist for Traits.

In order for these to work you will need to keep the Training Bracelets (with the desired Traits) in your inventory and you will need to be wearing Living Armor. While in your inventory they will “lock” your living armor to only acquire and level the traits of which you have the bracelets for.

If you have Bracelets with Solar Powered and Strong Legs then your armor will only acquire and level up Solar Powered and Strong legs.
