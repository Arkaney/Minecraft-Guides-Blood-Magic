Upgrading your living amor with Draft of Angelus will only give you an extra 100 upgrade points (200 max) but this really limits what level and how many traits you can have. The Ritual of Living Evolution can be built using the Ritual Diviner (dusk), this ritual costs 50,000LP to activate and will need to be activated each time you upgrade a set of Armor as this ritual only upgrades the set of armor that is currently being worn.
