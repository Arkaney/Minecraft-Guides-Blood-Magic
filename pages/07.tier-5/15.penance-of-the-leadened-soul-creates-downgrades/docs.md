An extra 200 upgrade points are very useful but some of the traits at higher levels have higher requirements such as Level 10 Tough Palms costs 350 Upgrade points. Luckily there is a way to go into minus with upgrade points.

Using the Penance of the Leadened Soul Ritual you are able to create downgrades, these downgrades will hinder you but in exchange give you more upgrade points by going into minus.

The Penance of the Leadened Soul Ritual will need an item Frame and a chest, the chest needs to have certain ingredients and the item frame will need the activator, once the ritual has been activated the items from the chest will be consumed and a downgrade tome will be placed into the chest. The ritual costs LP each time you wish to create a tome. Each level of the downgrade tome will require the same Activator but more ingredients.

Each downgrade that is applied to the Living Armor will hinder your character when the armor is worn, here is a list of all the downgrades, how many points they will give you and how they hinder you:

These tomes can be found in JEI as they may be different depending on your mod pack. The left-most items to go into the chest while the middle item goes into the item frame. You can also press “u” on the Master Ritual Stone.
