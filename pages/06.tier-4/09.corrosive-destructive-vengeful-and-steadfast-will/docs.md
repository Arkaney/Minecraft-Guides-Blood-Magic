Up until now the only type of Will that is accessible is normal Demonic Will, there are however more types of will. Corrosive, Destructive, Vengeful and Steadfast Will are the other types of will that can be acquired, these other types of Will can be used in Rituals and can also be used with the Sentient weapons.

Before getting into how and what we can do with these other types of Will you will need to create some. In older versions of the mod, you had to plop a few Crystallizers down and wait for a different type of will to spawn. This now **DOES NOT WORK**.

### Resonance of the Faceted Crystal 
The only way to create these crystals is via the Resonance of the Faceted Crystal ritual, once built you will need to activate the ritual (this costs 20,000) and then put a Demon Crystallizer on top of the ritual stone. Next, you will need to ensure you fill the Aura with Will, this will slowly cause the Crystalizer to grow a normal demonic Will Crystal.
