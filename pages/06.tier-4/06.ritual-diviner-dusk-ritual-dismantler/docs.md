The Ritual Diviner you currently have will give you access to basic rituals, with access to the Tier 4 Altar you can craft the Dusk version of the Ritual Diviner. This Diviner will allow you to craft Greater Rituals and basic Rituals.

The Diviner acts just like the previous version, shift right clicking scrolls forwards and shift left clicking scrolls backwards. Hovering over the Diviner will tell you more about the ritual and holding shift while hovering over it will tell you what runes are needed and what direction it will face. You can also set the orientation of the ritual (north, south west and east) by left clicking.
