These 4 new types of Will do come in useful, not only can they be used to augment Rituals but they can also be used in Sentient/Armor/Tools/Weapons, in order for the Sentient Armor/tools/Weapons to use the desired type of Will you must have a gem with the highest amount of Will of the type you wish to use:

Certain types of Will can give general bonuses and more specific bonuses with the Sentient Sword. To enable these you will need to right-click with the Tool/weapon in hand while having the desired gem in your inventory, the Tool/Weapon will change colour depending on the type of will.

### Sentient Axe/Shovel/Pickaxe
Using a certain type of Will with any of the Sentient Tools will give them a small buff to their speed and damage stats. If you are carrying more than 1,000 will you can drop your Tool/Weapon on the floor and it will follow you around and fight for you. 

The will effects for all the tools are the same, the only difference is the tools attack damage with no will:
