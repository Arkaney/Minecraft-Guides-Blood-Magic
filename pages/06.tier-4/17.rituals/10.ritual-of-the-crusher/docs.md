The Ritual of the Crusher mines blocks from the 3x3x3 cube directly beneath the Master Ritual Stone and places them into the inventory on top of the Master Ritual Stone. The chest location can be configured but it has to be in a 2 block radius of the Master Ritual stone. The area of which the ritual can break blocks can also be configured but this can only be a maximum of 9 blocks away from the Master Ritual Stone.
