The Crack of the Fractured Crystal ritual can be placed below (or above, depends on where you want your mob farm to be ) the Gathering of Forsaken Souls ritual by placing the Master Ritual Stone a few blocks Below (or above) the Master Ritual Stone of the Gathering of Forsaken Souls Ritual. It is strongly advised you place your mob farm for the Gathering of Forsaken Souls Ritual ABOVE the ritual, as the Crack of the Fractured Crystal fits nicely below the Gathering of Forsaken Souls Ritual:

It does not itself generate Demonic Will Aura though, so you need to supply it by either feeding back crystals or putting a Tartaric Gem with Will into a Demon Crucible. This should eliminate the need for going out to farm demonic will unless you fail to supply mobs to feed it and/or run out of Will. 

The area in which mobs are damaged can also be altered but it will need to be within a vertical range of 9 blocks and a horizontal range of 9 blocks. The area in which crystals grow can also be altered but it will need to be within a vertical range of 6 blocks and a horizontal range of 4 blocks of the Master Ritual Stone, but the area defined must contain at most 250 blocks.
