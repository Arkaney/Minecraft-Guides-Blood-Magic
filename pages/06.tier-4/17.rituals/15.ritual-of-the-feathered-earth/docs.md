This ritual will reduce fall damage down to 0 in a certain area. When near the ritual (25 block radius around the Master Ritual Stone)) you will gain a Feathered Buff for 1 second (this will keep refreshing). Falling into or near the ritual from great heights will apply the buff and negate fall damage.
