**Activation Cost**: 40,000LP  
**Cost per teleportation**: 2,000LP  

This ritual is very useful on servers as once it is activated it will teleport players not on the whitelist 100 blocks away in a random direction. This only works if someone gets within 12 blocks of the Master Ritual Stone.

To add people to the whitelist a chest must be placed on the Master Ritual stone with a blood orb that has been bound to a player inside the chest.
