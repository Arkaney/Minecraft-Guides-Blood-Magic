**Activation Cost**: 500LP  
**Cost block placed**: 250LP  

Why bother building Altars by hand when you can get a Ritual to do it for you. The Assembly of the High Altar Ritual will use the blocks that are placed in a chest (on top of the Master Ritual stone) to build a Blood Altar at the cost of LP.
