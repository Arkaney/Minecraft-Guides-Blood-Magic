**Activation Cost:** 2,000,000LP  
This ritual fits perfectly around the Blood Altar (if positioned correctly), once activated this ritual will transfer LP from your personal network back into the Blood Altar, this ritual does come at a cost. For every 1 LP transferred back into the Altar 2LP will be drained from your personal network.

>>>>> Currently, this Ritual is not fully implemented : you can spend 2,000,000 LP to activate it, but nothing else will happen and you wonâ€™t be able to define the area.
