Reap of the Harvest Moon searches a 93 block area centered on the Master Ritual Stone for mature plants. If it finds any, it breaks them. It will replant the plant if any seeds were dropped. Take note that this ritual does not chop down trees.

Reap of the Harvest Moon does not collect the dropped items. Use a Call of the Zephyr to collect them.
