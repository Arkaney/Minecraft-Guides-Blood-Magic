**Activation Cost**: 50,000LP  
**Cost per Â½ Heart of Damage**: 20LP  

The Ritual of the Feathered Knife searches a 31x31x41 area around the Master Ritual Stone for players. When it finds someone, it deals one damage to them and generates Life Essence in the nearest Blood Altar (in a vertical range of 14 blocks and a horizontal range of 9 blocks). Each point of damage costs 20 LP from the activator's Soul Network and generates 100 LP in the Altar. This effect respects any Runes of Self-sacrifice around the Altar.

The Ritual of the Feathered Knife will not reduce a player's health below 3 hearts by default.
