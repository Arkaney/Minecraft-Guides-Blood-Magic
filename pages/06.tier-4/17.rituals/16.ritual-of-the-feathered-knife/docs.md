**Activation Cost**: 50,000LP  
**Cost per ½ Heart of Damage**: 20LP  

The Ritual of the Feathered Knife searches a 31x31x41 area around the Master Ritual Stone for players. When it finds someone, it deals one damage to them and generates Life Essence in the nearest Blood Altar (in a vertical range of 14 blocks and a horizontal range of 9 blocks). Each point of damage costs 20 LP from the activator's Soul Network and generates 100 LP in the Altar. This effect respects any Runes of Self-sacrifice around the Altar.

The Ritual of the Feathered Knife will not reduce a player's health below 3 hearts by default.


| Will Type | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Raw | Increases the speed of the ritual based on the total Will in the Aura |
| Corrosive | Uses the player’s Incense to increase the yield: for the cost of 20 LP, converts all your HP above the minimum health for sacrificing into the right amount of LP in the Altar + Bonus % if you are “Incensed” |
| Steadfast | Sets the minimum health for sacrificing from 30% to 70% (if there is at least 10 Steadfast Will in the Aura) |
| Destructive | Increases the yield of the ritual based on the total Will: gives a bonus between 0 and 20% depending on the quantity of Destructive Will in the Aura |
| Vengeful | Sets the minimum health for sacrificing to 10 % (if there is at least 10 Vengeful Will in the Aura) Overridden by Steadfast for the Owner if active. |

>>>>> Even without Steadfast, Vengeful has no effect on the Owner. So maybe Steadfast isn’t even effective for the non-Owners.

If you’re an adept of Self-sacrifice (and if you don’t want to eat all the time), you can combine this Ritual with the Ritual of Regeneration, but without Will effects, it’ll lead to a loss of LP: it costs 20 LP to convert 1 HP into 100 LP and 100 LP to regenerate 1 HP.
But with Corrosive Will and the Bonus % of the Incense Altar, you can produce a lot and even get a better yield than the Well of Suffering Automation (having Tough Palms lv10 and a lot of Runes of Self-sacrifice helps too).
