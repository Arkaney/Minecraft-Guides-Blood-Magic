The only way to create different Will crystals is via the Resonance of the Faceted Crystal ritual, once built you will need to activate the ritual and then put a Demon Crystallizer on top of the ritual stone. Next you will need to ensure you fill the Aura with Will, this will slowly cause the Crystalizer to grow a normal demonic Will Crystal.
