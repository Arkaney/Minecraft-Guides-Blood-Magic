This ritual can also be modified with Will, this will must be fed into the Aura otherwise it will not work:

| Will Type | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Raw Will | Ritual will affect players as well as mobs |
| Corrosive Will | Disables Gravity |
| Destructive Will | Increase fall damage of affected entities |
| Steadfast Will | Allows the ritual to affect bossâ€™s |
| Vengeful Will | Amplifies the grounding effect and increase fall damage |
| Vengeful & Corrosive | Grants Levitation |

This ritual can also have its range set, currently there is no limit on how big the range is, when using the ritual Tinkerer on the ritual you will get an error message but you still be able to set a new area.
