We can release different types of will into the aura by placing will crystals that were grown via the Resonance of the Faceted Crystal ritual or by simply using standard Will. Setting up multiple Demon Crucibles can be expensive, it does let you control what chunks have Will in the Aura.

![](Demon%20Pylon.jpg)

The Demon Pylon acts as a beacon for Will in the Aura, pulling the Will from neighbouring chunks (those chunks that are directly next to it in the four cardinal directions, not diagonal) into its chunk. The Pylon will attempt to equalize the Will in its chunk with its neighbour so that the Pylons chunk has as much Will as its highest neighbour for each Will type. This process only happens one way, however: if the neighbouring chunk has less Will in it than the Pylons chunk, the Will will not transfer the other direction.
