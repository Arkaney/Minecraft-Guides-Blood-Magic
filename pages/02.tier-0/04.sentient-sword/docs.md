Snares are not the best way to collect Demonic Will, they can get expensive and very annoying to use. Put the spare Petty Tartaric Gem (craft one if you haven't already) into one of the 4 outside slots of the Hellfire Forge as well as an Iron Sword. Add fuel (if you have a Gem with Will in it then you can use that) and you should get the Sentient Sword.

This sword has a few unique features that make it much more powerful than any old iron sword. Killing mobs with this sword will make the mobs drop Demonic Will (no more snares). If you have a gem then the Demonic Will will be deposited into it, if the gem is full or absent then normal Demonic Will will drop.

Before you go attacking mobs with this sword you will want to throw it on the ground and pick it back up again, for some reason this makes the sword a little more powerful. You can also right-click with the sword.

Currently, the sword is good as it is but as you upgrade your gems and collect more Demonic Will it will get more and more powerful but the Demonic Will must be in your inventory in a gem.

The sword can also be enchanted and enchanting looting on the sword will increase the amount of Will dropped.
