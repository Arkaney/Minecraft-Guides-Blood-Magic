Successfully building a Ritual is only one part of the puzzle, in order to turn these rituals on you will need a Weak Activation Crystal. You will only ever need to make one of these crystals (unless you lose it), these are simply made by putting a Lava Crystal into a tier 3 Altar with at least 10,000 LP in it.

Each Ritual will cost a certain amount of LP if you try to activate a Ritual without the required amount of LP in your personal network you will get an error message.  Many rituals with ongoing effects have an LP cost after activation, either based on action or time and running your personal network dry with an active ritual will cause it to stop functioning and may cause nausea or simply kill you.

Check how much LP you need for the ritual and fill up your personal network (via the blood orb)
