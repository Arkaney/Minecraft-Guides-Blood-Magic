As you are able to craft Imbued slates you can also craft a few more useful Sigils:

| Sigil Name | Sigil Effect | Sigil Cost |
|------------|--------------|------------|
|Sigil of the Blood Lamp| Right-clicking will throw an orb of blood that can be used as a light source  | 10LP |
| Sigil of Holding | Store 5 Sigils within it. While in hand, press H (by default) to open the Sigilâ€™s inventory, Shift + Scroll wheel to choose a stored Sigil | N/A |
| Sigil of Magnetism | Attracts nearby items | 50LP per 5 second |
|Sigil of Elemental Affinity | Provides protection from Falling, Burning and Drowning | 200 LP every 5 seconds |
| Sigil of the Claw | Grants a climbing buff | 100 LP every 5 seconds |

Most of these sigils will require other sigils to craft and all of these can be crafted using an alchemical array.
