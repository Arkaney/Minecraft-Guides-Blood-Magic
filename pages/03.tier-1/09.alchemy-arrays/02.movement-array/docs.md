By simply adding a feather (Reagent) and then redstone (Catalyst) to a blank array it will create a Movement array. This will send items or entities flying in the direction of the array when they come into contact with it:

Placing the array down in front of you will point the array in that direction. Things will fly further forward if they are air bound (jumping onto them or throwing items on). This boost will give you a little step up so be careful when putting this in tunnels that are 2 blocks high.
