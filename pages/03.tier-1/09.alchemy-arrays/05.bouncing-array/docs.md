Adding a slime ball (Reagent) and Redstone (Catalyst) into a blank array will give you the Bouncing Array, this will act like a slime slab Walking into it has no effect and falling on it from more than 1 block will make you bounce like on a Vanilla Slime Block. If the fall is less than 1 block, the Array will slowly drag you to the ground (once your feet are on a solid Block, you are still able to jump normally through the Array, which will pull you down in response).
