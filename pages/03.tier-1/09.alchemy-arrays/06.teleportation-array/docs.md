Drawn by an Ender Pearl (Reagent) and activated by a Redstone (Catalyst), this Array allows you (and the mobs) to teleport to the Teleportation Array (activated or not) it is pointing. A few restrictions, however, the targeted Array must be on the same y-level, on the same x-line (or z-line, depending on the orientation) and at most 20 blocks away. If the targeted Array is active and has a target too, staying on it more than a half a second after the teleportation will make you teleport again.
