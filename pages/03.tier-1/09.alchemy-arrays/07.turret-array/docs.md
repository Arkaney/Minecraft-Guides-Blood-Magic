A variant of the Skeleton Turret Array summoned by a Bow (Reagent) and an Arrow (Catalyst). To be effective, you must place a Chest below the Array and supply it with Arrows (no matter which ones) and it will shoot any hostile mob in a sphere between 3 and 31 blocks radius (and with a better aim than the Skeleton Turret, in my opinion).

All the Creepers on the Planks are cold Gunpowder. The one on the Stone canâ€™t be aimed directly.

Range size comparison between the Skeleton Turret (Spruce Planks) and the Turret (Oak Planks).
