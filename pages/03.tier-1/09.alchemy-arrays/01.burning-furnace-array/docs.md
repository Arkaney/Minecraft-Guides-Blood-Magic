Using a Coal (Reagent) and a Redstone (Catalyst) in a Blank Array, you’ll be able to supply up to 6 Furnaces stuck to the Array in fuel. This operation is not free: when you are in a 10 block radius of the Array, it will take you a ½ heart to cook 2 items if possible. The process can kill you if there are a lot of items to cook and if you are unable to either remove them or recover your lost hearts.
