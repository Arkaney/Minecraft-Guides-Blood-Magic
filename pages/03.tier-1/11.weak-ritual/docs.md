Now that you have your personal network setup with a good amount of LP, there are a few other useful rituals you can do. Rituals are essentially a structure that cost LP to activate and perform a certain task.

As you only have access to the Imperfect Ritual Stone you will be limited to what rituals you can perform. These rituals can not be accessed remotely. Each weak ritual is set up and activated the same way.
Each ritual consists of an Imperfect Ritual Stone and a block on top of it, to activate the ritual simply have enough LP in your network and right-click the Imperfect Ritual Stone. If you do not have enough LP in your network you will take damage or die.
