Any LP we generate (by stabbing ourselves or fighting monsters) is ported directly to the Blood Altar and currently, that is only useful for us if we want to craft within the altar, but that's not where blood magic ends.

Crafting a tier 1 blood orb can be done by filling up the altar with 2000 LP and then right-clicking the altar with a Diamond. You will then need to right-click it with it in hand so it will bind to you, a few more mechanics come into play as well as new toys and gadgets. Unbound blood orbs will not collect LP.
