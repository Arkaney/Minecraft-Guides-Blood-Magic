The Blood Altar will require a Demonic Will, Gold, Stone and a furnace to craft (this may vary depending on your mod pack). Once crafted you can place it down in the world, it is a good idea to have a whole room dedicated to this altar because as you progress through the mod the Altar will need a bigger and bigger “base” as it goes up in tiers. 

There are 6 Tiers to the Blood Altar and at its biggest, it will be 17x17x 8 in size.

Tier one is simply the Blood Altar on the ground, there is nothing else needed to upgrade this Altar.

In order to make any use of the Blood Altar, we will need to fill it with blood. Blood is referred to as LP (Life Points) and it's what you spend in the Blood Altar to craft items. There are a few ways to fill your Blood Altar, you will use the altar for the rest of the mod so it’s a good idea to go over all the ways that you can generate LP.

Note: You do not have to stand right next to your Altar when trying to fill it up with LP.
If you have The One Probe installed you can look at the Altar and hold Crouch to see how much LP is in the Altar.

You will also notice that the Altar will fill up with red liquid the more LP you store in it. All tiers can only hold 10,000LP. To increase the capacity of the altar you will have to make Runes of capacity.

Later on down the line, you will be making lots of Slates, these are crafted by putting stone in the Altar (right-clicking) with the required amount of LP. This can become very tedious but can be automated:
