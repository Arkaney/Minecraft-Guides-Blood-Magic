The Blood Altar will require a Demonic Will, Gold, Stone and a furnace to craft (this may vary depending on your mod pack). Once crafted you can place it down in the world, it is a good idea to have a whole room dedicated to this altar because as you progress through the mod the Altar will need a bigger and bigger “base” as it goes up in tiers. 

There are 6 Tiers to the Blood Altar and at its biggest, it will be 17x17x 8 in size.

Tier one is simply the Blood Altar on the ground, there is nothing else needed to upgrade this Altar.
