You will have noticed that you have a fair few Tartaric gems in your inventory (if you have been killing mobs) and that these small gems although they hold 256 will, itâ€™s still too small. By placing the Lesser Gem into a Hellfire Forge along with a block of Gold, a Diamond, an Imbued Slate and using another full gem we can upgrade these gems to Common Tartaric Gems.
