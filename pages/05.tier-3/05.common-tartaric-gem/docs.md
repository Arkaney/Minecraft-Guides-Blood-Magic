You will have noticed that you have a fair few Tartaric gems in your inventory (if you have been killing mobs) and that these small gems although they hold 256 will, itâ€™s still too small. By placing the Lesser Gem into a Hellfire Forge along with a block of Gold, a Diamond, an Imbued Slate and using another full gem we can upgrade these gems to Common Tartaric Gems.

Ensure you do this process with empty gems as upgrading these will remove any Will stored in them. Once you have crafted one, you can transfer any will you have in any lesser gems by simply holding them and holding right-click.

These new gems hold up to 1,024 Will, this also means that your sword will do more damage when it is full:

|              | Tier 0 | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Tier 4 | Tier 5 | Tier 6 | Tier 7 |
|--------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Will         | 0      | 16     | 60     | 200    | 400    | 1000   | 2000   | 4000   |
| Damage       | 6      | 7      | 7.5    | 8      | 8.5    | 9      | 9.5    | 10     |
| Attack Speed | 1.6    | 1.6    | 1.6    | 1.6    | 1.6    | 1.6    | 1.6    | 1.6    |

This damage increase will only happen if you have a gem in your inventory with over 1,000 Will. You will not be able to stack gems as the sword will only count the highest amount of will in your inventory in 1 gem.

At tier 5 (1,024 Will), dropping the sword on the ground will consume 100 will and spawn a Sentient Specter. This spectre is an animated version of the Sentient Sword and it will follow you around. It can be picked up by shift right-clicking or killing it. If wounded, it will take some time to heal outside of battle. The spectre will attack anything you fight - whether you attack or are attacked - except for creepers. Note this also applies to players. Enchantments are retained through this method, and the sword will not lose durability in battle this way. This will also work with the Sentient Pickaxe.
