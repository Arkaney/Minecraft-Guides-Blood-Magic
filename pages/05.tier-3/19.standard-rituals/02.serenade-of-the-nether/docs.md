**Activation Cost**: 20,000LP  
**Cost per lava source created**: 500LP  
Once activated this ritual will spawn a lava source block onto the Master Ritual Stone, this will flow so be careful where you are building this ritual. This Ritual can also be augmented with different types of Will:

| Type of Will   | Effect on Ritual |
|----------------|------------------|
| Raw Will       | This will decrease the cost of each lava source spawned. Raw Will also allows the lava to be spawned straight into a container (such as a tank), this container must be within a 9 block radius of the Master Ritual Stone |
| Steadfast Will | Fire resistance will be applied to any player within range of the ritual, this range can be configured but it must be with a 9 block radius around the Master Ritual Stone | 
| Corrosive Will | Entities that have fire resistance (Blazes and Zombie Pig men) are damaged severely, the range of this can also be augmented but it must be within a 9 block radius of the Master Ritual Stone. |
| Vengeful Will  |Entities within range have Fire Fuse applied to them. This will make the entity act like a rocket, first it will be lit like a fuse and then be launched into the air. The range of this can also be altered but it must be within a 9 block radius of the Master Ritual Stone. |
