This ritual causes Entities that walk on the Master Ritual Stone to be thrown into the air, they will land safely on the Master Ritual Stone and be thrown up again but not landing on the Master Ritual Stone can lead to death. Sneaking over the Master Ritual Stone will not cause entities to be propelled upwards.
