**Activation Cost**: 5,000LP  
**Cost per ore**: 50LP  
This ritual is useful for ore collection, as it will pull ore blocks from the ground and place them within the ritual. This ritual will bring up ore to the surface every 40 ticks. The default radius that this ritual operates is 3 blocks in each cardinal direction, giving an area of 7x7 blocks centred on the Master Ritual Stone.
