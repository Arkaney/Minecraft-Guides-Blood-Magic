Now that you have the Divining Rod, Ritual Stones and a Weak Activation crystal you can create Rituals. Each Ritual will have a cost to activate and a running cost or cost per action. This depends on the ritual and will vary. If you do not have enough LP in your network these rituals will start to drain your health and can/will eventually kill you if you can't turn the ritual off fast enough or fill up your network quickly.

All Rituals can be modified in the configs and with the Ritual Tinker, some of the below rituals can be modified to run off different types of Will, unfortunately you will not have access to these other types of will until you upgrade your altar to Tier 4
