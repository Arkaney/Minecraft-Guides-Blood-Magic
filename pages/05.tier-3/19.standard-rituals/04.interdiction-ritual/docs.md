**Activation Cost**: 1,000LP  
This ritual will repel all non-player mobs by about 2 blocks from the Master Ritual Stone (by default). Mobs within this range are not affected by fall damage, though that safety net wears off as soon as they are pushed away.

The Push area can also be defined, it needs to be within a vertical range of 9 blocks and a horizontal range of 9 blocks.
