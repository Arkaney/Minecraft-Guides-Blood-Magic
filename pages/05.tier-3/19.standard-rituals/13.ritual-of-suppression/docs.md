This ritual will suppress all liquids in a set radius, liquids within a 10 block radius of the Master Ritual Stone will be replaced with Air. When the ritual is turned off the liquid will return to its original place. This ritual is named The Dome of Suppression in the hand book but in the Diviner, it is the Ritual of Suppression.

Currently, there is no way to set the suppression area beyond the default 10 block radius.
