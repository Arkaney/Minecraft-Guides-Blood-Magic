This Ritual will search the inventory above the Master Ritual Stone for food. It will feed any food it finds to players in a 33x33x33 area centred on the Master Ritual Stone. This Ritual only applies the saturation of the item consumed. It will prevent a player's hunger bar from decreasing, but will not fill it back up.
