These tools and weapons are simple to make, by placing “Binding Reagent” and a Diamond Sword/Axe/Pickaxe/Shovel into a blank array you will be able to craft tools/Weapons that have no durability. These weapons run off LP, once you have crafted one of these weapons they will be inactive, shift right clicking them will activate them, as long as these Weapons/Tool are active they will be draining 20 LP every 4 seconds.
