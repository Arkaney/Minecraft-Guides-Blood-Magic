When growing these crystals there are a few things you should watch out for. To spawn a new Crystal Cluster in a Demon Crystallizer, you need to get the atmospheric aura to 90-100 points. Depending on how odd a number of points you have in the aura, it may not be possible to reach this range by burning another crystal. If burning a crystal would overshoot 100, the crystal instead just sits in the Crucible, doing nothing.
