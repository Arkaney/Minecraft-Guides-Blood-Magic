In order to upgrade the Blood Altar to Tier 3 you will need 20 runes, these can be blank or any of the previous runes that were available. These runes can be replaced a little later on so opting for blank runes, for now, will get the job done. You will also need 4 blocks of glowstone or 4 sea lanterns, either work.
