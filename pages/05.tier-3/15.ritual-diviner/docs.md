Before jumping into more advanced rituals it is highly recommended that you craft the Ritual Diviner. This tool will help you build all the Standard Rituals and takes the guesswork out of building each ritual. Remember this Diviner is only for basic Rituals! However, it can be upgraded to a Ritual Diviner (Dusk) for more advanced rituals.

Holding the Ritual Diviner in hand and hold Shift while right-clicking will cycle through all the available rituals, you can then hover over a master Ritual stone which will then show a ghost layout of the ritual. This is where each specific ritual stone should be placed and what type of stone should be used.
