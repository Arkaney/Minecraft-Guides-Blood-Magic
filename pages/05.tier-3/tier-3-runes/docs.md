Now that we have access to the Tier 3 Altar, we also have access to Imbued Slates! These are crafted in the same way as the other slates, but they cost 5,000 LP each to craft. With these new slates also come with a few new runes that will help increase the LP storage of our Altar and also increase the Altars transfer rate.
