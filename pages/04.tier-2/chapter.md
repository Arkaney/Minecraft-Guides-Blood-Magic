# Tier 2

Before you jump into tier 2 of the Blood Altar it's a good idea to have a few things in place:

* Demonic Will
	* Have a few gems filled and stored away
* Personal LP network
	* Fill up your personal LP network (5k currently)
* More than 1 Altar
	* You can have more than one altar, and more than one blood Orb.



Tier 2 is a rather quick tier so you probably won't spend too much time in it. This does not mean there are no fun tools to play around with.
