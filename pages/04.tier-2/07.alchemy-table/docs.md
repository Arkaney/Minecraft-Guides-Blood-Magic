With the Apprentice Blood orb you will be able to craft a few new things in the Alchemy Table. You can still use the Apprentice Blood Orb to craft any recipes that were available with the Weak Blood orb. Each potion costs LP to produce.

* Neurotoxin
	* This is used later on when you have the Magicians Blood Orb (more on this later)

Now that you have the apprentice orb the Alchemical Table can also be used to make potions, now this process is slightly different to traditional means but it also does have its advantages. These are not potions per se and are more like flasks with multiple uses. Each potion still needs its ingredients but instead of putting them in one at a time (Nether Wart > Redstone>Glowstone) you can put them in all at once. 

The base of each potion will first need a Potion Flask, this will require the Apprentice Blood Orb and at least 100LP in your network.
