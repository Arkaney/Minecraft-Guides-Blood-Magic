Upgrading the Blood Altar to Tier 2 requires 8 Blank Runes, you can also use a few speed runes but since we only have 8 runes to play with and not much LP it seems a waste to craft extra Slates for Speed Runes. 

Tip: Over-speeding your altar can result in running out of blood if you're depending on self-sacrifice partway through rituals to provide sufficient blood.

These 8 Blank Runes must be placed underneath the Blood Altar, Right below the Altar should be left empty:

The Tier 2 Altar looks different but still can only hold a maximum of 10000 LP.
