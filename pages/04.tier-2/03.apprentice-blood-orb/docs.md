With a new tier Altar comes a new Tier Blood Orb, before we can craft the Apprentice Blood orb you will need to have 5000 LP in your Altar (Stabbing yourself with food is the best option). Once you have the required amount of LP you will need to put a block of Redstone in the Tier 2 Blood Altar (Right-clicking). After some time the Redstone Block will turn into your Apprentice Blood Orb.

This blood orb will hold 25000 LP and has a filling speed of 100 LP. You will need to bind this orb to yourself just like the previous tier.
