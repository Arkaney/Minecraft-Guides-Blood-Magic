The Incense altar will help you when filling up your Blood Altar. With the apprentice Blood Orb you can now craft Wooden Paths. You will need to make 36, and place in a 3x3 square in each cardinal direction from the base of the Incense Altar. These blocks can be one higher or one lower than the previous level, as long as each side matches the pattern. Now, you can start adding different types of blocks to the 3x3 squares in each corner.
