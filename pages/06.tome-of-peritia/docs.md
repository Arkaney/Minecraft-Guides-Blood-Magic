The Tome of Peritia is a great little book that will hold experience for you, but instead of holding it in liquid form or shard form like most mods, the experience is held in the book that can be recalled when needed. Simply by shift-right clicking the tome in your hand, you can store a level of experience into the book (or down to the level if you have a partial level). Right-clicking with the tome will grant you up to the next level if there is enough experience stored in the book. The total experience, as well as the equivalent level stored, is displayed on the tooltip of the tome.
