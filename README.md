# Welcome to the Minecraft Guides: Blood Magic Github Repository! 

Using Github we are able to update and edit each guide without having to take each guide offline! This also allows other GitHub users to add updates to each guide whether it be corrections or updates. This also allows us to save older versions of each guide as an archive.

Using githubs also enables us to have strict version control and makes it much simpler to communicate changes with everyone.

As we move each guide to GitHub/Website the associated Google Doc will be closed, Google Docs will only be used as an initial starting point of each guide.

Every page and image from each guides website is here!

## How to edit files
Editing guides and having your changes be accepted is relatively simple and can be done by anyone who has a GitHub account.

We will always give you details on why your request has been denied.

## Folder Layout
There are 2 types of Pages, Docs and Chapters, each page is in a .MD format (more details on MarkDown can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)). The only pages anyone will need to edit are docs.md.

Each page has its own Folder and in that Folder is the page (docs.md) with all the content. Any images that are attached to each page are within the pages folder.
